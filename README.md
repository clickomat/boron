# The Fifth Element: Travel
[Heroku]9https://accessibletravel.herokuapp.com/)

Our goal with Accessible Travel is to create safe, sensory-friendly, certified travel options for parents and individuals on the Spectrum.
                
Taking a vacation together, as a family, can be one of the biggest challenges of having a family member who has sensory processing complications. 

This site provides parents with a community to share ideas, plan trips with other families, review destinations, and explore travel options at some of the most beautiful places in the world.

As a parent of an individual on the spectrum you can be assured that the destinations featured on Accesible Travel have been certified or highly recommended by those in the Autism Community.
